Polus is an open source Among Us server implementation!

Latest supported version: `v2020.10.8i` (pc/mobile).

**WARN:** Polus is still at an early stage of development and massive
refactoring or breaking API changes are possible.

**NOTES:** Currently, as with the default server, it is the host player who
makes decisions and manages the game logic.\
Ultimately, the goal is to make the server manage the game logic.
